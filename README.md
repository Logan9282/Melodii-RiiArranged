Wii Music Melodii Was A Mod for the 2008 Wii Game, Wii Music Started in Early 2021 
by CheckerTheJester, RainbowKappa, Benjamin Halko, and Gavin Krolczyk
with later contributions from Paniaal. This and the first version of RiiMajor, another Wii Music mod,
were created as people learned how to convert .midi files into .brseq files , which are used by Wii Music for it's songs.

By 2022 Melodii was rebranded as Wii Music Rii-Arranged and eventually the team abandoned the mod at the start of 2023. The Team eventually got back together but me nor the rest of the team has any official plans to bring the mod back. With this said, this repo serves to archive the old patches we made for the mod and for me , RainbowKappa, and for a reason for me to continue modding the game. Atm I really don't have a reason to but I know people want me to for some reason..
