TLDR: This repo serves to archive the old patches we made for the mod before 2024. The mod is still in a semi-active development as of 2024.

Wii Music Melodii Was A Mod for the 2008 Wii Game, Wii Music Started in Early 2021 
by CheckerTheJester, RainbowKappa, Benjamin Halko, and Gavin Krolczyk
with later contributions from Paniaal. This and the first version of RiiMajor, another Wii Music mod,
were created as people learned how to convert .midi files into .brseq files , which are used by Wii Music for it's songs.

By 2022 Melodii was rebranded as Wii Music Rii-Arranged and took a hiatus throughout 2023, the team came back in early 2024.
